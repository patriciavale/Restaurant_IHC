# Restaurant_IHC
An Android application for the search and reservation of restaurants. Made for the Human-Computer Interaction (IHC) course, in University of Aveiro.

## Introduction
This application was built in Android Studio. It allows its users to search for restaurants and make reservations (including payment, if needed) in a single application. It is also possible to see the details and menu of a restaurant the user's currently in by scanning a QR code or with an NFC tag in the restaurant. Some features were not implemented, such as the search of restaurants in a map around the user's location and a points system that offered discounts. The application's database was also developed in another course (Databases).

## Application
This application is composed by several screens where the user can navigate through. These are divided into the following categories:
 - **Start** (Tutorial and log in)
 - **Reserve** (Search and filter restaurants and its details)
 - **Restaurant** (Options for inside the restaurant)
 - **Favorites** (User's favorite restaurants)
 - **Settings** (Application's and user's settings)
 - **Database** (Details on the database)
 
 ## Repository
 This repository displays the different screens of the application, as well as some additional details on the developed database and some extras (paper mockup and application studies).
 
 ## Credits
 This project was made by Patrícia Vale and Vítor Morais, for the Human-Computer Interaction (IHC) course in University of Aveiro, in 2018.
